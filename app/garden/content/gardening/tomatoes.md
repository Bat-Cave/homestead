- Pick before extreme heat
- Breaker stage ripening for indoor storage

- Ripe: room temp, stem down, out of sun, use 3-5 days
- Unripe: room temp, single layer, do not stack

## Long-Term Preservation
- Freeze whole (skins slip off after thaw)
- Cook into sauce, blend, freeze
- Canning (tested guidelines)
- Dehydrating (slice, salt, dry, store airtight)

## Heat Management
- Shade, mulch, water deeply/infrequently
