## Harvesting
- 4-6 inches tall
- Before flowering/bolting
- Harvest early morning
- Cut outer stems first, leave inner growth
- Cut 1-2 inches above soil

## Short-Term Storage
### Jar Method
- Trim stems
- Place in jar with 1-2 inches water
- Loosely cover leaves with plastic bag
- Refrigerate
- Change water every 2-3 days

### Damp Towel Method
- Wash and dry
- Wrap in slightly damp paper towel
- Store in airtight container
- Refrigerate 5-7 days

## Long-Term Preservation
### Freezing
- Chopped + oil in ice cube tray (best for cooking)
- Whole leaves: wash, dry, freeze flat
- Texture softens after thawing

### Drying
- Not recommended (flavor degrades)

## Heat Management
- Provide afternoon shade in Southern AZ
- Harvest aggressively before heat spikes
- Succession plant every 2-3 weeks during cool season
