## Harvest
- 3-5 inches, firm, glossy
- Green for sharp heat, red for sweeter
- Use pruners

## Short-Term Storage
- Do not wash
- Refrigerate in crisper
- Use within 1-2 weeks
- Store in breathable bag

## Long-Term Preservation
- Freeze whole/sliced, no blanching
- Pickle in vinegar brine (24-48 hours)
- Ferment in 2-3% salt brine, 7-14 days
- Dehydrate, grind or store whole

## Heat Management
- Slight water stress increases heat, overwatering reduces flavor
